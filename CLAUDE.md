# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Node-based terminal manager** (source-available, proprietary — see `LICENSE`): multiple real terminals live on a single
pan/zoom canvas as draggable nodes. Target users are people with ADHD / disorganized
workflows who benefit from a spatial layout over stacked tabs. Long-term vision includes
remote access and paid features — the architecture is built so those slot in without a
UI rewrite (see Transport abstraction below).

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # deps + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall hook)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run build      # production build into out/
npm start          # preview the production build (electron-vite preview)
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
npm run rebuild    # re-run electron-rebuild for node-pty if you hit ABI/native errors
```

No test runner is set up yet. `npm run typecheck` is the fastest correctness gate.

## Process model (Electron, three contexts)

The codebase is split by Electron process boundary — keep code on the correct side:

- **`src/main/`** — Node/Electron main process. Owns all native + filesystem access:
  `pty-manager.ts` spawns `node-pty` processes; `workspace-store.ts` reads/writes the
  workspace JSON in `app.getPath('userData')`. The renderer must never import these.
- **`src/preload/`** — the only bridge. `index.ts` uses `contextBridge` to expose a
  narrow API on `window.nodeTerminal` (typed in `index.d.ts`). `contextIsolation` is on,
  `nodeIntegration` off.
- **`src/renderer/`** — React UI. Talks to main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`.
- **`src/shared/`** — types and IPC channel names imported by all three sides. `ipc.ts`
  is the single source of truth for channel strings; never hardcode a channel elsewhere.

PTY output flows main → renderer over per-session channels (`pty:data:<sessionId>`),
input flows renderer → main over `pty:write`. node-pty is kept **external** in the bundle
(`externalizeDepsPlugin` in `electron.vite.config.ts`) because it's a native module.

## Key abstraction: TerminalTransport

This is the load-bearing design decision. The renderer depends only on the
`TerminalTransport` interface (`src/renderer/terminal/transport.ts`), never on IPC or
node-pty directly. The current implementation is `LocalTransport` (IPC → node-pty). A
future `RemoteTransport` (WebSocket to a remote agent) implements the same interface, so
remote access / paid tiers can be added without touching the canvas or terminal UI. When
adding terminal-session features, extend the interface — do not reach around it.

## State & persistence model

**React Flow is the single live source of truth** for nodes. There is intentionally no
separate store mirroring node state — earlier dual-source designs caused sync bugs.
`src/renderer/state/workspace.ts` holds only pure helpers: the color palette, the node
factories (`createTerminalNode`, `createAgentNode(agentId, …)` — with `createClaudeNode` kept
as a thin `createAgentNode('claude', …)` wrapper, `createStickyNode`, `createGroupNode`,
`createEditorNode`, `createDiffNode`), the group transforms (`groupSelectedNodes`,
`ungroupNodes`, `duplicateNode`), and the `nodeStatesToFlow` / `flowToNodeStates`
serializers. Node kinds: `terminal | sticky | group | editor | diff`. A node's `data`
carries `title, color, group, tags, collapsed, expandedHeight, shell, cwd, text,
initialCommand, filePath, diffStaged`, and `agentId` (which agent CLI a terminal node runs —
persisted). `nodeStatesToFlow` defaults a missing `kind` to `terminal` for backward compat and
migrates the legacy `tags:['claude']` marker to `data.agentId = 'claude'`.

Persistence has two layers:

- **Layout + config** (`workspace.json`, schema v2): a list of **projects**, each with its
  own `nodes`, `viewport`, `color`, and default `cwd`, plus the `activeProjectId`. Auto-saved
  on a debounce (and via the dock Save button). Lives in `app.getPath('userData')`.
  `main/workspace-store.ts` migrates v1 single-canvas files into one project; an **empty**
  project list is valid and persisted (→ welcome screen). The renderer re-saves on launch.
- **Live terminal sessions** (tmux): terminals continue where they left off across node
  remounts *and* full app restarts, including running processes. See below.

`settings.json` is a separate store (`main/settings-store.ts`, `state/settings.ts`).

## Projects (tabs)

Each project is one canvas/page; terminals and notes belong to a project. The `projects`
zustand store (`renderer/state/projects.ts`) holds project metadata + the *serialized* nodes
of all projects. **React Flow remains the single live source of truth for the *active*
project's nodes only.** The contract:

- The active-project effect in `Canvas.tsx` (keyed on `activeProjectId`) loads that project's
  serialized nodes into React Flow. `loadingRef` suppresses dirty-marking during this load.
- Before any project switch / add / delete, `commitActiveToStore()` serializes the live
  React Flow nodes back into the store, so nothing is lost. Then disk is written.
- Switching away unmounts the old project's `TerminalNode`s → their tmux clients detach but
  the sessions keep running; switching back reattaches. tmux session names are per-node-id
  (globally unique), so projects never collide.
- The tab caret menu's **Close project** (`closeProject`) is **non-destructive**: it sets
  `project.closed = true` (hidden from the tab bar, kept on disk with all nodes) and leaves the
  tmux sessions running, so closing just detaches like a project switch. Closed projects are
  reopenable from the **"Recently closed"** list on `WelcomeScreen` (`reopenProject` → restores
  nodes, which reattach warm or cold-restore). `hasProjects` counts only **open** projects, so
  closing the last open one shows the welcome screen. **Permanent** deletion (`deleteProject`:
  `transport.destroy(nodeId)` per terminal + drop agent status + SSH teardown) now only happens
  via the `×` on a "Recently closed" entry.
- A project's `cwd` (folder picker, `dialog:select-folder`) is passed to terminal/Claude
  node factories so new terminals open there. **Folder ↔ project is deduped:** "Open folder…"
  reuses the existing project with that `cwd` (and its nodes) instead of creating a duplicate.

## Terminal session continuity (tmux)

`src/main/pty-manager.ts` runs each terminal inside a persistent tmux session
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s nt-<nodeId>`) on a dedicated socket (`-L node-terminal`) with
a generated config (`-f <userData>/tmux.conf`, so the user's `~/.tmux.conf` never
interferes; status bar off, mouse on, 50k history). Because the tmux *server* outlives the
app, sessions survive when no client is attached.

Lifecycle, by intent:
- **Node unmount / window close / app quit** → `kill()` only detaches the PTY client; the
  tmux session keeps running. `PtyManager.killAll()` deliberately does NOT kill sessions.
- **Node reopen / app relaunch** → a new PTY attaches to the same `nt-<nodeId>` session and
  tmux redraws current state.
- **User clicks ×** → `destroy(persistKey)` runs `tmux kill-session`, permanently ending it.

The node id is the `persistKey` (passed to `transport.create`), so it must stay stable.
If tmux is unavailable, `PtyManager` falls back to a plain shell (no cross-restart
continuity). `findTmux()` resolves an absolute path because GUI apps don't inherit the
shell PATH; `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` are stripped from the child env to avoid nesting refusal.

### Cold restore (machine reboot)

tmux only survives an **app** restart — a **machine reboot kills the tmux server**, so every
`nt-<nodeId>` session is gone. To bridge that, `create()` returns `PtyCreateResult` with a
`fresh` flag: it runs `tmux has-session` *before* spawning, so `fresh=false` means a warm
reattach (tmux redraws) and `fresh=true` means a cold start (first open OR post-reboot). On a
cold start the renderer (`TerminalNode.tsx`) reconstructs state instead of relying on the dead
session (you can't keep a live OS process across a reboot):
- **Scrollback replay** — `main/scrollback-store.ts` keeps a byte-capped (`256 KB`) snapshot of
  each tmux session's recent output under `<userData>/terminal-scrollback/`, refreshed on a
  timer (`SCROLLBACK_SNAPSHOT_MS`) + on detach/quit (`tmux capture-pane -e`). On a cold start the
  renderer reads it via `pty.readScrollback` and writes it back into xterm (with a "session
  restored" separator). Warm reattach skips it (tmux already redraws). Deleted with the node in
  `destroySession`.
- **Agent resume** — on a cold start of a node whose `agentId` is in `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, the
  renderer re-launches the agent CLI: `resumeCommand(agentId, sessionId)` (from the session id
  persisted in `agentStatus` localStorage — `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `gemini
  --resume`) when known, else the bare `launchCmd`. The one-shot `data.initialCommand` still wins
  on the very first open, so the agent is never double-launched.

## Terminal node lifecycle (gotchas)

`src/renderer/nodes/TerminalNode.tsx` is the trickiest file:

- The xterm instance + PTY session are created once in a `useEffect(…, [])` and torn down
  on unmount. The component persists across re-renders because React Flow keys nodes by
  `id` — never change a node's id, or you'll respawn its terminal.
- **React StrictMode is deliberately not used** (`main.tsx`) — double-mount would spawn
  two PTYs per node.
- The xterm container is `nodrag nowheel`; a transparent **hover-guard** overlay sits on top
  until you dwell `settings.panHoverDelay` (so quick drag = move node, scroll = pan). After
  the dwell the guard is removed and xterm takes input. The header stays draggable.
- A `ResizeObserver` drives `FitAddon.fit()` + `transport.resize`. Canvas zoom is a CSS
  transform, so it does *not* change `clientWidth` — cols/rows stay stable across zoom.
  `scale-fix.ts` patches xterm's mouse coords so text selection stays aligned when zoomed.

## Node kinds (all rendered by React Flow custom nodes)

- **terminal** (`TerminalNode.tsx`) — xterm + tmux (see above). Header: collapse, color,
  click-to-rename title, ✦ AI-name, ×. Body has a **hover guard** overlay: dwell
  `settings.panHoverDelay` (default 600 ms) before the terminal takes focus — before that,
  drag = move node, scroll = pan canvas. **Cmd/Ctrl+M** (while hovered) toggles a markdown
  render of the captured output. Tag chips via `NodeTags`.
- **Agent** (`createAgentNode(agentId, …)`) — a terminal preset that runs an agent CLI as its
  `initialCommand` (runs once on open via `transport.write`, then cleared), with `data.agentId`
  set. Builtins (`claude`/`codex`/`gemini`) come from `AGENT_CONFIG` (clay color etc.);
  `createClaudeNode` is the `'claude'` wrapper. Agent nodes get extra behavior **gated by the
  agent's capabilities** (see **Agent support** below): a busy/working badge + unread dot +
  completion notification + session-name chip (hook-capable agents), content search, and the
  Claude-only **Branch conversation** action. Custom user-defined agents spawn + show
  process/terminal-title status only.
- **sticky** (`StickyNode.tsx`) — colored note, free text, collapsible.
- **group** (`GroupNode.tsx`) — real React Flow parent/child frame; `groupSelectedNodes`
  reparents children (`parentId` + `extent:'parent'`, relative positions), `ungroupNodes`
  restores absolute. `nodeStatesToFlow` sorts parents first (React Flow requirement).
  Visually: a dashed rounded frame in the group color with a floating label pill (color dot
  + editable name) on the top border and ungroup/× top-right (on hover/selected). The
  `NodeResizer` line is hidden (`lineStyle` transparent) so it can't draw a sharp-cornered
  box; the selection ring is a `box-shadow` instead, which follows the same `border-radius`.
- **editor** (`EditorNode.tsx`) — Monaco code editor for a `filePath`; reads/writes via
  `fs:read`/`fs:write`, auto-detects language from the path, ⌘S saves, dirty dot. A
  **Preview / Edit** toggle (or ⌘M while hovered) renders the live content as markdown.
  **Image files** (png/jpg/gif/webp/bmp/ico/svg/avif) skip Monaco and show an `<img>`
  preview instead — read as base64 via `fs:read-binary` into a `data:` URL (CSP allows
  `img-src data:`), on a checkerboard backdrop with the pixel dimensions in the header.
- **diff** (`DiffNode.tsx`) — Monaco diff editor; `diffStaged` chooses HEAD↔index (staged)
  vs index↔working (unstaged) via `git:show-file` + `fs:read`. Read-only.

Monaco is wired in `renderer/editor/monaco-setup.ts` (language workers bundled via Vite
`?worker` — no CDN; CSP `worker-src` allows them). Markdown rendering is shared in
`renderer/lib/markdown.ts` (`marked` + DOMPurify sanitize).

## Agent support (Claude / Codex / Gemini / custom)

The app is a pluggable multi-agent system: Claude Code is one builtin of
several. Extra terminal-node behavior is driven per agent by a registry + capability lists, a
shared 4-state model, and a **transient** zustand store `state/agentStatus.ts`
(`{state, agentId, unread, session, sessionId, loop}` per node id; the live `state` is **not**
persisted — only `unread`/`session`/`sessionId` go to localStorage under
`nodeterm.agentStatus`, migrated once from the legacy `nodeterm.claudeStatus` key).

- **Agent registry + capabilities** — `src/shared/agents/config.ts` holds `AGENT_CONFIG`
  (claude/codex/gemini: id, label, spawn command, color, …) keyed by an **open** `AgentId`
  type (so custom ids fit). Capabilities are membership lists, not flags:
  `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`, `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`, `RECURRING_CAPABLE`,
  `BRANCH_CAPABLE`, `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`, `USAGE_CAPABLE`, with helpers (`hasHooks`, `canBranch`,
  `canContextLink`, …). Branch, Context Link and the usage indicator stay **Claude-only** purely by being in
  only `BRANCH_CAPABLE` / `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` / `USAGE_CAPABLE`. UI gates on these helpers — no
  hardcoded `=== 'claude'`. **Custom agents** (user-defined in Settings, `customAgents`) are in
  no capability list: spawn + terminal-title + process status only.
- **State via each agent's hooks → shared 4-state model** — detection uses the agent's own
  hooks, **not** output parsing. `src/shared/agents/normalize.ts` has per-agent normalizers
  (`normalizeClaude`/`normalizeCodex`/`normalizeGemini`) that map each agent's native hook
  events to a `NormalizedAgentEvent` over the shared `AgentState` (`working | waiting | blocked
  | done`) plus subagent/recurring/session kinds. Canvas's listener consumes
  `NormalizedAgentEvent` from `agent:status`, drives the `agentStatus` store, fires throttled
  (5s/node) background notifications, and records the session id. Header shows a pulsing
  **RUNNING** (working) / **NEEDS YOU** (waiting/blocked) badge.
- **Hook server (loopback HTTP)** — `src/main/agents/hook-server.ts` is a main-process
  loopback HTTP server (per-session bearer token, fail-open) that the installed hook scripts
  POST to; it replaced the old `fs.watch` signal-log mechanism. `buildPtyEnv` injects the
  node id + endpoint/token into each spawned session's env; because tmux sessions **outlive
  the app**, the server also writes `<userData>/hook-endpoint.env` so a relaunched main
  process re-advertises the same endpoint (restart handoff). A `setRawListener` channel feeds
  the per-node context-window meter (`context-tail.ts`) and subagent live-transcript
  (`subagent-tail.ts`) for claude.
- **Hook installers** — `src/main/agents/hooks/` holds per-agent hook services + an installer
  registry `MANAGED_HOOK_INSTALLERS`. `managed-script.ts` builds the POSIX hook script that
  POSTs to the server (env-gated: a no-op in the user's normal terminals, active only in
  sessions nodeterm spawns; the `claude-signals` string is kept as the idempotency marker that
  migrates users off the old hook). claude → `~/.claude/settings.json` and gemini →
  `~/.gemini/settings.json` (shared `install-helper.ts`, merged/idempotent, preserving other
  tools' hooks); codex → `~/.codex/hooks.json` + `~/.codex/config.toml` trust entries
  (`codex-trust.ts` — the hash gates whether codex runs the hook).
- **Unread + notification** — on a busy→idle edge while the window is unfocused
  (`document.hasFocus()`), the node is marked unread (header dot, minimap stroke, project-tab
  dot). If notifications are enabled, `window.nodeTerminal.notify()` → main `app:notify`
  (shown only when `mainWin.isFocused()` is false); clicking it focuses the window and sends
  `app:focus-node` → `Canvas.focusNodeById` (selects + centers, switching projects via
  `pendingFocusRef` if needed). A one-time consent prompt gates notifications; toggle in
  Settings (`notifyOnClaudeDone`). Unread clears on focus/select.
- **Session name ⇄ node title** (agents in `RENAME_CAPABLE`, Claude-only) — two-way sync between a
  node's `title` and the agent's own session name (the name shown in `/resume`).
  - **session → title (read):** the authoritative name lives in the transcript `.jsonl`, not the
    OSC terminal title (`/rename` does **not** update OSC — a known Claude gap — so reading the
    file is the only thing that works after a **resume**). `main/transcript-reader.ts`
    `readSessionName(sessionId, cwd)` resolves the session file (by sessionId, else newest under
    the cwd slug) and `pickSessionName` returns the latest `custom-title`'s `customTitle` (the
    `/rename` name) else the latest `ai-title`'s `aiTitle` (auto name). Exposed over
    `pty.readSessionName`. `TerminalNode` polls it (~4 s) **only while the title still auto-tracks**
    (`data.titleAuto`, default true on agent nodes) and adopts it as the `title`. `term.onTitleChange`
    now feeds the `session` chip only.
  - **title → session (write):** the moment the user renames the node by hand (header rename box /
    ✦ AI-name / sidebar / command palette → all funnel through `applyManualTitle` or
    `renameSession`), `titleAuto` flips to **false** (polling stops overwriting) and the chosen name
    is pushed into the live session as `/rename <name>` via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`, same
    one-way bridge as Branch's `/branch`; works whether or not the node is mounted).
  - The launch command is left bare (no `-n`) — Claude's own name is canonical until the user
    overrides it; `titleAuto` is persisted so an overridden name survives reload/resume.
- **Search** — the command palette (⌘K) matches the session name + tags + `nt-<id>` in the
  hint, and substring-searches each terminal's **visible buffer** (captured via `pty.capture`
  on palette open, cached ~3s); content matches show "found in output".
- **Subagent visualization** (agents in `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`) — `subagent-start`/`subagent-end`
  normalized events (from Claude's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` on tool `Agent`/`Task`, correlated
  by `tool_use_id`) drive a transient `state/agentNodes.ts` store. Canvas renders each subagent
  as an **ephemeral** `SubagentNode` (display-only card: type + task + working/done) connected by
  an **edge** to its parent agent node. These ephemeral nodes/edges live outside the React Flow
  `nodes` state (merged only at the `<ReactFlow>` prop), so they're never persisted
  (`flowToNodeStates`) nor in undo/dirty. Fan-out is cleared on the next new turn / session-end /
  node close. (Subagents share the parent's process — no PTY.) Each card shows
  duration/tokens/tool-uses and **expands** (click) to a **live transcript**:
  `main/subagent-tail.ts` resolves the subagent's own transcript file
  (`<…>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, matched by `tool_use_id` via the sibling
  `.meta.json`), tails it read-only, formats each line (assistant text + tool calls + results),
  and streams chunks over `agent:subagent-activity` into the store.
- **/loop, /schedule & /cron node** (agents in `RECURRING_CAPABLE`) — detected from the **tools**
  the agent invokes (robust; users often phrase it in natural language so the prompt rarely starts
  with the slash): `PreToolUse` for `Skill` (skill ∈ loop/schedule/cron), `CronCreate` (→ cron,
  label = cron expr · prompt), or `ScheduleWakeup` (→ loop) — plus a `UserPromptSubmit`
  `/loop|/schedule|/cron` prompt-prefix fallback, all surfaced as `recurring` normalized events.
  Sets `agentStatus.loop` ({count, prompt, items, kind}); for in-session `loop` each turn-done
  bumps the count + appends `lastMessage` (schedule/cron run in the background, so they aren't
  counted). Cleared on session-end. Renders an ephemeral **LoopNode** labelled by kind, connected
  by an edge to the parent, plus a small header badge.
- **Branch conversation** — node action (`IconBranch`, Claude-only via `BRANCH_CAPABLE`): sends `/branch` into the
  existing terminal via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`) and opens a new Claude node that
  resumes the parked original with `claude --settings … -r <ORIGINAL_ID>`. The original id is
  the session id already known from hooks; `lib/claudeBranch.ts` is the fallback that parses
  `pty.capture` output when the id isn't known. The source node stays on the new branch.
- **Context Link** — a node action gated by `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` (Claude-only): drawing an
  edge between two Claude nodes lets each READ the other's context on demand (pull, not push).
  `src/main/context-link.ts` (+ pure `context-link-core.ts`) writes a per-node link file under
  `<userData>/context-links/` and installs a `get-linked-context` skill + a self-contained CLI
  (run via Electron-as-Node) that prints the linked node's transcript / summary / terminal
  output. Transcript paths are learned from the hook raw-listener; on connect, an idle-gated
  one-line note is injected into each endpoint. (Replaced the earlier MCP-based bridge.)

## Canvas interaction & panels (`Canvas.tsx` is the hub)

- **Context menus** (`components/ContextMenu.tsx`, portal, icons from `components/icons.tsx`):
  pane right-click = add nodes at cursor (terminal / Claude / sticky / open file) + select
  all + fit; node/selection right-click = group, color, duplicate, align-to-grid, collapse,
  markdown-view (terminals), delete. Actions live in `Canvas.tsx`, operate on `targetIds`.
- **Add menu** = bottom dock (`Dock.tsx`) `+`, mirrored by the pane menu and command palette.
- **Undo/redo**: debounced snapshot of the nodes array on settle (drag/edit), `pastRef`/
  `futureRef` stacks, ⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z + dock buttons. History resets per project load; skipped
  while typing in inputs/terminals.
- **Selection/pan**: box-select on left-drag (`SelectionMode.Partial` — touch to select);
  pan = middle-drag or trackpad two-finger (`panOnScroll`, `zoomOnScroll:false`); pinch
  zoom. Right mouse is free for the context menu.
- **Delete** (Delete/Backspace) opens `ConfirmDialog` before removing selected nodes.
- **Command palette** (`CommandPalette.tsx`): ⌘/Ctrl+K; `Canvas.buildCommands` (create,
  switch project, jump to node by title/tag, open file…).
- **Explorer** (`ExplorerPanel.tsx`, 🗂 / ⌘⇧E): lazy file tree of the active project `cwd`
  (`fs:list`); click a file → opens an editor node; right-click → Copy Path / Reveal.
- **Source Control** (`main/git-service.ts` system `git` + `gh`, `SourceControlPanel.tsx`,
  ⎇): file-level **stage/unstage** (+/−), **discard**, click a file → **diff node**,
  **branch switch/create**, commit (message box at top) + push / sync / publish, **gh
  sign-in** banner (runs `gh auth login` in a new terminal via `initialCommand`), recent
  commits. **AI commit message** (✦ Generate) and **AI terminal naming** both use
  `main/commit-message.ts`: a BYO local agent CLI (claude/codex/custom) spawned read-only on
  the staged diff / captured terminal output (no built-in model); agent + extra prompt in
  Settings.
- **Settings** (`SettingsPanel.tsx`, ⚙ / ⌘,): font/cursor (live to xterm + Monaco), default
  shell, grid + snap, pan-hover delay, double-click focus, accent, tmux on/scrollback,
  commit agent, `seenShortcuts`.
- **Shortcuts** (`ShortcutsPanel.tsx`, ? / ⌘/): shown once on first launch (`seenShortcuts`).
- **Welcome** (`WelcomeScreen.tsx`): shown when no projects exist.
- **Window chrome**: macOS integrated title bar (`titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`); the tab
  bar (`TabBar.tsx`) is the drag region with the `nodeterm` logo + a rounded pill of project
  tabs. Cmd+M is intercepted in `main/index.ts` `before-input-event` (else macOS minimizes)
  and forwarded to the renderer via `app:toggle-markdown`.
- **Theme**: macOS dark palette as CSS tokens in `styles.css` `:root` (`--accent` = systemBlue,
  label/separator opacities, SF font stack). Canvas background is black with dot grid.

## Packaging & auto-update

Built with **electron-builder** (config in the `package.json` `build` block: appId
`com.nodeterm.app`, productName `nodeterm`, mac dmg+zip for arm64 **and** x64, `asarUnpack`
node-pty, output `dist/`). The app icon is generated from the nodeterm mark by
`scripts/make-icon.mjs` (sharp → `build/icon.png`, 1024², gitignored — regenerated by
`make-icon`); electron-builder derives the `.icns`. Scripts: `npm run make-icon`, `npm run dist`
(local **unsigned** arm64 `.dmg` smoke test). Production release signing/notarization and the
update-feed hosting are handled outside this repo.

Auto-update uses **electron-updater** (`src/main/updater.ts`, `initUpdater(win)` from `index.ts`):
runs **only when `app.isPackaged`** (dev = no-op), checks on launch + every 6h, auto-downloads,
forwards the lifecycle (`update-available` / `download-progress` / `update-downloaded` / errors)
to the renderer over IPC. `components/UpdateCard.tsx` shows the strip + **Restart to update** →
`updates.restart()` → `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`; on `update-downloaded` an OS notification
also fires when the window is unfocused. Exposed via `window.nodeTerminal.updates` (`UpdateApi`).
macOS *silent* self-install requires a signed+notarized build; unsigned builds still surface
the card for a manual download.

**Backend check feed** (`src/main/check.ts`, successor to the static `announcements.json`): the
**main process** calls `GET https://api.nodeterm.dev/v1/check?version=&os=&channel=stable` (so the
renderer CSP stays `'self'`) on launch + every 6h, cached 5 min, returning `{ messages, update }`.
Exposed split over two IPC handlers: `announcements.fetch()` → `messages`, `appUpdatePolicy` →
`update`. `components/AnnouncementBanner.tsx` (stacked above `UpdateCard` under the tab bar in a
`.top-banners` column) shows the newest message the user hasn't dismissed (dismissed `id`s persist
in `localStorage`); `update.mandatory`/`minSupported` flips `UpdateCard` into a blocking required-
update state. The call no-ops under `DO_NOT_TRACK`/`NODETERM_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` or in unpackaged
builds (unless `NODETERM_API_BASE` targets a local server). Schema example:
`docs/announcements.example.json`. **Telemetry** (`src/main/telemetry.ts`) is a separate opt-out
ping to `api.nodeterm.dev/v1/telemetry` (version/OS on launch + daily), gated on
`settings.telemetryEnabled` + the same build/DNT guards; toggle in Settings → Privacy.

## Conventions

- Code comments, UI strings, and identifiers are all in **English**. Match this when editing.
- Path aliases: `@shared/*`, `@renderer/*` (see the tsconfig files / vite config).
- **Subagent model:** when dispatching subagents (implementers, reviewers, etc. — e.g. in
  the subagent-driven-development workflow), use the latest model, **Opus 4.8**
  (`claude-opus-4-8`). This overrides any cheaper-model defaults in a skill's model-selection
  guidance.
